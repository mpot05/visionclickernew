ok so this code may or may not be broken. 
Specifically, if the number 2 object when rendered is broken, change the scale in reality composer to 0.005,
I think I pushed that before fixing it and now it won't let me push my changes.

THIS PROGRAM IS STUPID USE AT OWN RISK
git decided to just not push any of the required packages and thus the entire program dies and refuses to work if you try to run it. So until I can get gitlab to accept the changes and push the stupid packages, it brokey.

updoot part 2
If you really wanna try using it, clone the repository, unzip the packages zip file, replace the already existing packages folder and MAYBE that'll work. BIG maybe.
